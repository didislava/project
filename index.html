                    Due to the decentralization and small size of the country,

                        People would have to check local tax calculators of 
                        different cantons, calculate their health insurance premium, 
                        and check other factors in many different places on the web 
                        for every place they consider moving to. It is already a

                    Developing functionality for a cost comparison calculator 
                    required a detailed understanding of the specific types 
                    of data that needed to be collected and compared. 
                    Onix together with our client have worked closely 
                    to determine which factors and data sets are most 
                    relevant for their users, such as average rents, 
                    healthcare costs, and taxes in different municipalities, 
                    as well as collecting and integrating this data into the 
                    calculator.
                </p>
                <p class="solutions-text2 text">
                    After determining the types of data they would incorporate, 
                    Onix developers started building the calculator. 
                    This involved utilizing web development technologies 
                    like HTML, CSS, and PHP Laravel as Back-end server language.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the platform was coded, it underwent rigorous testing 
                    and iterations to ensure that it was intuitive and user-friendly. 
                    Our developers closely monitored the user experience and used
                        feedback to refine and improve the calculator's functionality
                        continually.

                            We created complex algorithms to calculate the costs associated with

                    "Onix was the ideal partner to get this project done - this became 
                    clear very early in the project tendering process when I quickly got 
                    the impression of their know-how, the work ethic and the collaborative 
                    culture they live.
                    <br><br>
                    Once we started to work, it was clear that they lived up to their 
                    promises and exceeded my expectations when they were very familiar 
                    with complex, country-specific laws and regulations from an early stage. 
                    Onix collaborates extremely well amongst their team members and the 
                    internal delivery processes are designed to perform.
                    <br><br>
                    After working with many in-house dev teams in major Swiss/Worldwide 
                    financial service providers over more than a decade, I can easily say that 
                    working with Onix was the biggest pleasure in all those projects. I highly 
                    recommend working with them if you want to get things done fast, thoroughly, 
                    in high quality and in a collaborative manner."
